# Ex. No. 3 – Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques  

## Aim:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. The following prompting techniques are used:  
- Straightforward Prompts  
- Tabular Format Prompting  
- Missing Word Prompting  
- Preceding Question Prompting  

## Algorithm:
1. **Straightforward Prompts**  
   - Provide direct instructions to the chatbot for handling queries.  

2. **Tabular Format Prompting**  
   - Use tables to organize information and guide the chatbot to respond in a structured format.  

3. **Missing Word Prompting**  
   - Use fill-in-the-blank style prompts where the chatbot completes the missing information.  

4. **Preceding Question Prompting**  
   - The chatbot refers back to the last question to give more relevant and connected answers.
     
## Output:
### **1. Straightforward Prompts**  
**Prompt:** *“Tell the customer about their order status.”*  
**Customer:** What’s the status of my order?  
**Chatbot:** Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by **5th September**.  

### **2. Tabular Format Prompting**  
**Prompt:** *“Show troubleshooting steps in a table format.”*  
**Customer:** My phone is not charging. What can I do?  
**Chatbot:**  

| Issue                  | Possible Cause                | Suggested Fix                        |  
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Phone not charging      | Faulty charging cable         | Try using a different cable           |  
|                         | Dust in charging port         | Clean the port gently with a brush    |  
|                         | Adapter not working           | Test with another adapter             |  

### **3. Missing Word Prompting**  
**Prompt:** *“The order will be delivered on ____.”*  
**Customer:** When will my order arrive?  
**Chatbot:** The order will be delivered on **6th September**.  

### **4. Preceding Question Prompting**  
**Prompt:** *“Always connect the response to the previous customer query.”*  
**Customer:** I didn’t receive my package yet.  
**Chatbot:** Since you mentioned that your package hasn’t arrived, let me check the shipping details for you. It looks like it’s out for delivery and should reach you by tomorrow.

## Result  
The chatbot was successfully able to respond to different customer queries using **Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, Missing Word Prompting, and Preceding Question Prompting**. Thus, the experiment of developing scenario-based chatbot responses using multiple prompting techniques such as straightforward prompts, tabular prompts, missing word prompts, and preceding question prompts was executed successfully.
